# Password Generator #

This project's goal was to create a password generator that would provide random strings of characters chosen by the user to create a safe and secure password to use however they choose.

## Motivation for Creation ##

This provides a randomly generated output that will allow a user the opportunity to protect themselves and their sensitive data, "Identity theft is not a joke, Jim!" - Dwight Schrute

## Build Status ##

This build is complete and features capabilities for edge cases. Some examples are if the user chooses a number outside of the 8 and 128 window for characters or if a user types in words instead of a number when prompted to choose their password length or even if the user incorrectly chooses no characters to be generated (see the screenshot portion below for examples of these cases)

## Screenshots ##

Here is an instance where the user chooses less than 8 characters:

Here is an instance where the user chooses more than 128 characters:
https://github.com/benwofford/homework-week-3/issues/2#issue-976228529

Here is an instance where the user does not confirm any characters for the password:
